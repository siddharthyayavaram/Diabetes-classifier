# Diabetes Classifier with Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, L1 and L2 Normalization, Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Least Squares Classification

This repository contains a diabetes classifier that employs various machine learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, L1 and L2 Normalization, Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Least Squares Classification. The classifier is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on a set of input features.

## Overview

Diabetes is a prevalent and serious medical condition. Predicting the risk of diabetes accurately is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. In this project, we explore different machine learning methods and normalization techniques to build a diabetes classifier.

The repository is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** In this section, we clean and preprocess the diabetes dataset. This includes handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Logistic Regression:** We implement a logistic regression model to classify individuals as having diabetes or not. Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks.

3. **Linear Regression:** We apply linear regression as a baseline model to compare its performance with logistic regression. Although not the ideal choice for classification, it helps us understand the importance of choosing the right algorithm.

4. **Normalization Techniques:** We experiment with L1 and L2 normalization techniques to evaluate their impact on model performance. Normalization helps in preventing overfitting and improving model generalization.

5. **Gradient Descent:** We implement both Batch Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent to optimize the logistic regression model. This section explores the differences between these two optimization techniques.

6. **Least Squares Classification:** We employ the least squares classification approach to assess its suitability for the diabetes classification problem.

7. **Performance Evaluation:** After implementing various models and techniques, we compare their performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve. This helps us identify the most effective approach.
